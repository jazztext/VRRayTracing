          SDK
            crashes on glBindVertexArray()
          Client
            works fine, vsync toggle works - off yields noticeably less latency

            A clear appears to be failing on rendertarget
            Any pixel without depth written to it after a clear is smeared
          Client - looks fine, no vsync control
        Extended
          SDK
            Compat
              smearing artifact feels odd in HMD - color buffer fails to clear
            Core
              depth buffer smears as well

      GLFW
        DebugHMD
          SDK
            smearing, or crash in BindVao depending on when render mode is switched
            getting a GLError: invalid value
            Could DismissInternal be deleting an incorrect VAO?
          Client
            works fine, VSync appears to have no effect
        Extended
          SDK
            looks OK when HSW is up, display won't refresh after it's dismissed until eventually, crash
          Client
            works, but very juddery
            VSync appears to stay off regardless of toggle, ~250 FPS
        Direct
          SDK, Client
            crashes at glfw_main.cpp:620 glfwSwapBuffers(g_pHMDWindow);
      SDL2

            SDK - crash in bindVAO, invalid operation
            Client - works fine
        Extended
          SDK
            get a GL Error: invalid operation on (maybe) the first VAO bind after DismissHSW
            Turn on vsync, wait until frame rate increases from 33 to 66(for only one reading), then switch: no GL error
          Client
            works, but very juddery
            VSync toggle appears to work, but yields sustained 33fps on, 250 off
